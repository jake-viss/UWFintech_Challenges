# UWFintech_Challenge_5

## Project Description
This project includes two seperate financial analysis tools:
1. An emergency fund finacial planner. This tool allows someone to visualize their current savings and portfolio and determine if it is worth enough to be considered an "emergency fund".
2. An expected return tool for a retirement portfolio. This tool will simulate different weighted portfolios over a selected timeframe and give us the expected return at the end of the period.
